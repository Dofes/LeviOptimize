# LeviOptimize

LeviOptimize is a performance optimization plugin for Minecraft Bedrock Dedicated Server (BDS), designed to enhance server performance by addressing low ticks per second (TPS) and frames per second (FPS) issues. This plugin operates within the LeviLamina framework, modifying BDS code to achieve significant performance improvements.

## Features

- **HopperItemFix**: Enhances server TPS by optimizing item transfers between hoppers and containers, addressing performance issues related to item duplication.

- **MovingBlockFix**: Improves FPS and server TPS by optimizing the handling of block entities with extensive NBT data during piston movements, reducing the frequency and load of data sent from the server to the client.
